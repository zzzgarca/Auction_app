## Features  
- **User roles**: sellers can post items, buyers can place bids  
- **Auction management**: create, view, and participate in auctions  
- **Database integration**: persistent data storage using an **Oracle SQL Server**  
- **Desktop application**: runs directly on the user’s PC as a standalone Java program

## Technical Details  
- **Language**: Java  
- **Architecture**: desktop client with database backend  
- **Database**: Oracle SQL Server  
- **Persistence**: JDBC-based communication with the database  
- **Execution**: runs directly on the PC without requiring a browser or web server  
- **Source code notes**: comments and variable names are written in **Romanian**
